# Seven Concurrency Models in Seven Weeks
## Chapter 2: Threads and Locks
### By David McElligott

.footnote[created with [RemarkJS](http://remarkjs.com/)]

---

# Day 1

* Basics of multithreaded code in Java
* Primary pitfalls to encounter
* Solutions to pitfalls

# Day 2

* Beyond the basics
* investigate facilities provided by java.util.concurrent package

# Day 3

* Concurrent data structures provided by standard library
* How to use concurrent data structures to solve problems

---

# Day 1: Mutual Exclusion and Memory Models

Basic unit of concurrency in Java is the Thread, which encapsulates a single thread of control

```java

public class HelloWorld {
  public static void main(String[] args throws InterruptedException {
    Thread myThread = new Thread() {
      public void run() {
        system.out.println("Hello World");
      }
    }
    myThread.start();
    Thread.yeild();
    System.out.println("Hello from main thread");
    myThread.join();
  }

}

```

---

# Day 1: Mutual Exclusion and Memory Models

output:

```
Hello from main thread
Hello from new thread
```

or

```
Hello from new thread
Hello from main thread
```

Mutual exclusion -- Using locks to ensure that only one thread can access data at a time


---

# Day 1: What We Learned

We covered how to create threads and use the intrinsic locks built into every
Java object to enforce mutual exclusion between them. We also saw the three
primary perils of threads and locks—race conditions, deadlock, and memory
visibility, and we discussed some rules that help us avoid them:

* Synchronize all access to shared variables.
* Both the writing and the reading threads need to use synchronization.
* Acquire multiple locks in a fixed, global order.
* Don’t call alien methods while holding a lock.
* Hold locks for the shortest possible amount of time.


---

# Day 2: Beyond Intrinsic Locks

Intrinsic locks are convenient by limited.

* There is no way to interrupt a thread that’s blocked as a result of trying to acquire an intrinsic lock.
* There is no way to time out while trying to acquire an intrinsic lock.
* There’s exactly one way to acquire an intrinsic lock: a synchronized block

---


# Day 2: Reentrant Lock

Intrinsic Lock

```java 

synchronized(object) {
  // use shared resource
}
```

Same behavior with explicit locking


```java
Lock lock = new ReentrantLock();
lock.lock();
try {
  // use shared resource
} finally {
  lock.unlock();
}

```

---

# Day 2: Interruptible Locking 

```java
final ReentrantLock l1 = new ReentrantLock();
final ReentrantLock l2 = new ReentrantLock();
Thread t1 = new Thread() {
  public void run() {
    try {
      l1.lockInterruptibly();
      Thread.sleep(1000);
      l2.lockInterruptibly();
    } catch (InterruptedException e) { System.out.println("t1 interrupted"); }
  }
};

```

---

## Day 2: Lock Timeout

```java
class Philosopher extends Thread {
  private ReentrantLock leftChopstick, rightChopstick;
  private Random random;
  public Philosopher(ReentrantLock leftChopstick, ReentrantLock rightChopstick) {
    this.leftChopstick = leftChopstick; this.rightChopstick = rightChopstick;
    random = new Random();
  }
  public void run() {
    try {
      while(true) {
        Thread.sleep(random.nextInt(1000)); // Think for a while
        leftChopstick.lock();
        try {
          if (rightChopstick.tryLock(1000, TimeUnit.MILLISECONDS)) {
            // Got the right chopstick
            try {
              Thread.sleep(random.nextInt(1000)); // Eat for a while
            } finally { rightChopstick.unlock(); }
          } else { // Didn't get the right chopstick - give up }
        } finally { leftChopstick.unlock(); }
      }
    } catch(InterruptedException e) {}
  }
}
```
Timeouts are rarely a good solution, its far better to avoid deadlock in the first place

---

# Day 2: Condition Variables

```java

ReentrantLock lock = new ReentrantLock();
Condition condition = lock.newCondition();
lock.lock();
try {
  while (!«condition is true»)
    condition.await();
  «use shared resources»
} finally { lock.unlock(); }

```

An operation is *atomic* if, from the point of view of another thread, it appears to be a single operation that has either happened or not--it never appears to be halfway through

---

# Day 2: Atomic Variables

## Benefits over using a lock

* Its not possible to forget to acquire the lock when neccessary
* Because no locks are involved its impossible for an operation on an atomic variable to deadlock
* Atomic variables are the foundation of *non-blocking*, *lock-free* algorithms, which acheives synchronization without locks or blocking


---

# Day 2: What We Learned

We saw how ReentrantLock and java.util.concurrent.atomic can overcome the limitations
of intrinsic locks so that our threads can do the following:

* Be interrupted while trying to acquire a lock
* Time out while acquiring a lock
* Acquire and release locks in any order
* Use condition variables to wait for arbitrary conditions to become true
* Avoid locks entirely by using atomic variables


---

# Day 3: What We Learned

We saw how the facilities provided by java.util.concurrent not only make it easier
to create concurrent programs, but also make those programs safer and more
efficient by doing the following:

* Using thread pools instead of creating threads directly
* Creating simpler and more efficient listener-management code with CopyOnWriteArrayList
* Allowing producers and consumers to communicate efficiently with ArrayBlockingQueue
* Supporting highly concurrent access to a map with ConcurrentHashMap
