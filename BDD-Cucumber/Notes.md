# Notes

## Communicating an Idea
* Living Documentation
* Scenarios are Concrete Examples

## Example
### Requirement: 
A customer should be prevented from entering invalid credit card details.
### Concrete Example:
If a customer enters a credit card number that isnâ€™t exactly 16 digits long, when they try to submit the form, it should be redisplayed with an error message advising them of the correct number of digits.
* Illustrates our requirements, think through the behavior

## Build trust in our code
* Slow Iterative Process

## Scenario
1. Get system into a particular state (context)
2. Do something (action)
3. Examine the new state (outcome)

Scenario: Successful withdrawal from an account in credit
  Given I have $100 in my account # the context
  When I request $20              # the event(s)
  Then $20 should be dispensed    # the outcome(s)

### Stateless
Each scenario must make sense and be able to be executed independently of any other scenario.

## Data Tables


## DAMP
Descriptive and Meaningful Phrases
* alternative to DRY
* In Gherkin DAMP trumps DRY

## Importance of ubiquitous language

# Cucumber's Big Secret
The tests and documentation are just a happy side effect; the real value lies in the knowledge you discover during those conversations.
