# Behavior Driven Development with Cucumber
### By David McElligott

# What is BDD?

* ## A method of communicating an idea
* ## It builds upon best practices of TDD and Agile
* ## Starts with a failing customer acceptance test that describes the behavior of the system from the customerâ€™s point of view [1]
* ## Used for acceptance tests, because it explains real user stories

# Why Behavior Driven Development?

### Have you documented that?
* #### Provides a shared repository of specifications

### Is that what you mean?
* #### Captures stakeholder requirements in a way that can be understood by domain experts, testers, and developers

### So how does this work?
* #### Deliverables and their expected behavior are documented as features

---

![Cucumber](https://cucumber.io/images/cucumber-logo.svg)
* ### BDD and collaboration tool
* ### Automated Acceptance Tests
* ### Cucumber uses a plain text DSL (Gherkin)
* ### Cucumber implementations are available for a number of languages
  * Ruby, Java, Groovy, JavaScript, Python

---

# How it Works

### 1. Describe Behavior in plain text

### 2. Write a step definition in Java

### 3. Run and watch it fail

### 4. Write code to make the step pass

### 5. Run again and see the step pass

### 6. Repeat 2-5 until all your steps are passing

# Gherkin

```terminal
Feature: Some terse yet descriptive text of what is desired
  In order to realize a named business value
  As an explicit system actor
  I want to gain some beneficial outcome which furthers the goal

  Scenario: Some determinable business situation
    Given some precondition
      And some other precondition
     When some action by the actor
      And some other action
      And yet another action
     Then some testable outcome is achieved
      And something else we can check happens too

  Scenario: A different situation
      ...
```

# Example Feature File

```terminal

Feature: Sign up

  Sign up should be quick and friendly.

  Scenario: Successful sign up

     New users should get a confirmation email and be greeted
     personally by the site once signed in.

     Given I have chosen to sign up
      When I sign up with valid details
      Then I should receive a confirmation email
      And I should see a personalized greeting message


  Scenario: Duplicate email

     Where someone tries to create an account for an email address
     that already exists.

     Given I have chosen to sign up
       But I enter an email address that has already registered
      Then I should be told that the email is already registered
       And I should be offered the option to recover my password
```

# Writing a Feature File

### Feature
Should describe a single feature that your are testing

```terminal
Feature: Refund item

  Sales assistants should be able to refund customers' purchases.
  This is required by the law, and is also essential in order to
  keep customers happy.
```

.footnote[.red.bold[*] [Feature File Example](#7)]

---
# Writing a Feature File

### Scenario
The specific scenario that this test will cover

* Each scenario must make sense and be able to be executed independently of any other scenario.

### Steps

* **Given:** Describes the initial state of the system

* **When:** Describes an event or an action

* **Then:** Describes the expected outcome

.footnote[.red.bold[*] [Feature File Example](#7)]

---

# Write a Feature File

### Background

If you are repeating your initial steps to set up the context it may be a good place for a Background

```terminal

Background:
  Given a $100 microwave was sold on 2015-11-03
    And today is 2015-11-18

```

Similar to the JUnit @Before annotated method


---

# Step Definitions
A Java method annotated with a step containing regex that will be used to match features with step definitions


By running the feature files without implementing matching step definitions, Cucumber will generate the regex for you.

    # Workflow

    * ### BA's work with domain experts to create acceptance tests in their domain specific language
    * ### Developers can then generate step definitions (Java methods) then  fill them out to perform whats described in the step definitions taking inputs if needed
